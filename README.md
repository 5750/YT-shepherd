# YT-shepherd
YT Shepherd is a Firefox add-on that lets you categorize YouTube channels as Recommended, Neutral, or Discouraged. It visually modifies thumbnails to reflect your preferences — guiding your attention and helping you stay productive, one tile at a time.

## Installation
Download the repository: Code -> Download ZIP
Then, in Firefox, go to about:debugging, click "This Firefox", then "Load Temporary Add-on" and select the extension file.

## Usage
Once the extension is installed, navigate to any YouTube video page.
Below each thumbnail, you'll see three buttons:
- Allowed: Adds the channel to the "Allowed" category.
- Neutral: Adds the channel to the "Neutral" category.
- Discouraged: Adds the channel to the "Discouraged" category.
Depending on the category, thumbnails will change their visual style to indicate the user’s preference.
